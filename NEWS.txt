## NEWS - The latest on what's going on with Adjutant

2020/14/01 : New Beta Features
Some new features that have been sitting in the dev branch have now been merged to the main branch. These featuers are:

- the ability to search semnatic scholar : process_ScholarSearch 
- use adjutant's commands with an existing data frame or text file : processsSingleFile
- speeded up for tidying the data corpus
- add custom stop words to tidy corpus cleaning

All of these beta featuers are on the command line only, not changes to the UI yet.

Some things in the pipe that dedicated Adjutant users might have some fun with are exploring the replacement of t-SNE with UMAP (should speed things up). Also looking to update the UI, but still working on the right direction.
